# Impact of degradation and time of sampling on skipjack tuna (*Katsuwonus pelamis*) gut microbiome composition
------------------------

## Introduction
The gut microbiome has the potential to be an effective indicator of individual and population health in fish given its sensitivity to internal and external stressors. However, without consistent and tested sampling protocols, its utility may be limited. Routine sampling of fish caught by commercial fisheries rarely occurs at the time of capture and more commonly occurs hours, days, or weeks after fish capture when the catch is unloaded in port. This delay in sampling provides time for the degradation and decomposition of the microbiome community potentially compromising the reliability of gut microbiome analyses. Unfortunately, these changes in the gut microbiome communities after the capture event are rarely investigated, with unknown consequences for the interpretation of the microbiome studies. Here, we investigated the post-mortem changes in the gut microbiome of skipjack tuna (*Katsuwonus pelamis*) preserved in RNA*later* at five different time points (immediately, 2 hours, 24 hours, 12 days, and 24 days after fish capture).
